# improving-LLM-analysis-report

Pre-trained model may achieve high performance by dataset artifacts. But they may fail when these artifacts are not present. So we need to investigate, analyze and improve the performance of the models.

About how to solve this, there are many ways. I used contrast datasets to find the need of improvement, and use adversarial datasets to improve the model, and get good results.

After comparing all the results, write a analysis report for it.
